Current errors:
* test-m2m-pc occasionally hits 99999 checkpoints instead of 100000
* running test-m2m with memcheck reveals invalid memory accesses associated with teardown
* running test-m2m and test-m2m-pc with memcheck reveals lost memory (caused by not joining the pthread that is itself running kfc_teardown?)
